# ⚛️ React by Building — 30 Mini React Projects

This repository represents my journey of **learning React by building**, focusing on understanding component-based architecture, state management, hooks, lifecycle behavior, and routing — all through hands-on practice.

This is a collection of **30 React mini projects**, created as simple practice projects to understand React concepts step by step — starting from the basics and gradually moving toward more advanced patterns.

## 🧠 Projects Breakdown

### 🟢 React Basics

1. **Hello React Portfolio Card** — Intro to JSX, import/export, and component structure
2. **Reusable Button Component** — Props-based reusable components
3. **Login / Logout Toggle** — Conditional rendering using `? :` and `&&`
4. **Render Counter (Virtual DOM Concept)** — Understanding re-renders through console logs
5. **Todo List Renderer** — Rendering lists dynamically using `.map()`
6. **Theme Switcher (Context API)** — Global light/dark theme using Context
7. **Redux Counter** — State management using Redux (increment, decrement, reset)

### 🟡 React Hooks

8. **Like Button** — State handling using `useState`
9. **Live Clock** — Side effects and intervals using `useEffect`
10. **Focus Input** — DOM access using `useRef`
11. **Expensive Calculation Optimizer** — Performance optimization with `useMemo`
12. **User Profile (Context)** — Sharing data across components with `useContext`
13. **Show / Hide Text Toggle** — Simple UI toggle using state

### 🔵 React DOM Events

14. **Click Tracker (Capture vs Bubble)** — Understanding event phases
15. **Press & Hold Button** — Mouse events (`onMouseDown`)
16. **Login Form** — Handling form submission with `onSubmit`
17. **Email Validation** — Input validation using `onBlur`
18. **Double Click to Like** — Handling `onDoubleClick` interactions

---

### 🟠 Component Lifecycle Concepts

19. **Fetch Users on Mount** — `componentDidMount` behavior
20. **Cleanup Timer** — Clearing intervals on unmount
21. **Error Boundary** — Handling runtime errors with fallback UI
22. **Title Updater** — Reacting to updates with `componentDidUpdate`

---

### 🌐 Routing in React

23. **Multi-Page Portfolio** — React Router basics (Home, About, Contact)
24. **Navigation Menu** — Routing with `Link` instead of `<a>`
25. **Router Types Demo** — BrowserRouter vs HashRouter
26. **Dynamic User Page** — Route params using `useParams`
27. **Go Back Button** — Navigation with `useNavigate`
28. **Active Navbar** — Styling active routes using `NavLink`
29. **Color Picker App** — State-driven UI updates with `useState`

## 🌱 What I Gained From This Repository

- A solid understanding of React basics
- Better clarity on how components work together
- Practical experience using hooks and lifecycle concepts
- Hands-on practice with routing and navigation
- More confidence in building React apps from scratch

## 📎 Note

This repository is focused on **learning by building**. The projects are intentionally kept small and simple so the focus stays on **React concepts, logic, and behavior**, rather than complex UI.
